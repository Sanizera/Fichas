# Fichas

## Purpose

This project is designed to help manage and store customer records ("fichas") for a small business or personal use. It provides a simple web interface for entering customer information and saves all data in a structured JSON file on the server. The goal is to make it easy to register, organize, and retrieve customer details securely and efficiently.

## What the Project Has Now

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML pages for scheduling, new customer registration, and login.
  - JavaScript for navigation between pages.
  - Input masks for CPF and phone number fields.
  - Email format validation.
  - Form submission to the backend.

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js server using Express.
  - CORS enabled for cross-origin requests.
  - Receives customer data via POST requests (`/save-file`).
  - Stores all customer records in `fichas.json` as an array of objects.
  - Responds with JSON messages for success or error.

## How to Use

1. Start the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

2. Open the main HTML file (e.g., `src/routes/new_customer/customer.html`) in your browser.

3. Fill out the customer form and submit. The data will be saved in `fichas.json`.
