# Fichas

## Purpose

This project helps manage and store customer records ("fichas") for small businesses or personal use. It provides a simple web interface for entering customer information and saves all data in a structured JSON file on the server. The goal is to make it easy to register, organize, and retrieve customer details securely and efficiently.

## Features

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML pages for scheduling, new customer registration, and login.
  - JavaScript for navigation between pages.
  - Input masks for CPF and phone number fields.
  - Email format validation.
  - Form submission to the backend.

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js server using Express.
  - CORS enabled for cross-origin requests.
  - Serves all static files from the `src` directory.
  - Receives customer data via POST requests (`/save-file`).
  - Stores all customer records in `fichas.json` as an array of objects.
  - Responds with JSON messages for success or error.
  - Search endpoint for retrieving records.

## How to Run

   ```

2. For development (auto-reload on changes):
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. For production:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to:

## Notes

- All frontend files in the `src` directory are served by the Express server.
- For automatic browser reload on HTML/CSS changes, use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in VS Code or refresh the page manually.

## Future Improvements

- Add endpoints to retrieve and update customer records.
- Improve frontend design and user experience.
- Add authentication for secure access.
- Export data or generate reports.
